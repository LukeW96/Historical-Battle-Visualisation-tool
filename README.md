# Historical-Battle-Visualisation-tool

This tool is used to create animations of historical battles, there are simple features implemented, including:

Various shapes to depict unit type, rectangle = infantry, circle = archer, triangle = cavalry

User can display information with unit, (unit name, and troop count)

Play button doesn't work, but the user can manually navigate through the frames

User currently has to recall which frames are keyframes, some visual feedback will be added at a later date

This tool is created via processing3 and a processing library called ControlP5 to create the GUI, links to both are available below.


# processing available at https://processing.org/
# Controlp5 available at http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/


Future work:

Fix play button bug.
Give visual information on which frames are keyframes
